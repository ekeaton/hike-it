# Hike-IT!

Description
-----------
One of the best parts about living in the PNW is how incredibly beautiful the scenery is. I enjoy getting outside and exploring hiking trails near-by or afar. I created this app to provide users with a quick reference to trails based on the city and state they choose. Users are given the location, star rating, length and link for more information to each trail. Let the adventures begin!
